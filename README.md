# Dominic Beesley’s 4th Milestone Project

This project is my fourth milestone project for Code Institute, and it’s the Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project. The aim of the project, according to the project guidelines, was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The project also contains an authentication mechanism, and allows users paid access to the site's data and or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product service.

In order to fulfil these aims, I’ve created a website that I’ve called ‘The Coffee Break.’ The website allows users to register and purchase bags of coffee or coffee accessories from around the world, as well as read about coffee-related news.

The project has been deployed using Heroku, and can be viewed at [http://domscoffeeshop.herokuapp.com/]( http://domscoffeeshop.herokuapp.com/).


## UX <hr>

Add image of website on different devices from Am I Responsive.

My website, ‘The Coffee Break,’ is a website for users to visit and buy new coffee-related products, as well as find out about what’s happening in the coffee world.

Before I started making the website, I made a rough wireframe of what I hoped to achieve. 

### User Stories
I have identified three types main users who wold potentially be using this site, which are the site owner, registered users, and non-registered (or anonymous) users.

#### For the site owner:

#### For registered users:

#### For non-registered users:

### Introduction
* This website was deployed using Heroku.
* The code for the site was written using Gitpod.

### Creating the app on Heroku

### Pushing to Heroku
* On my Gitpod workspace, I logged into Heroku using the CLI, with the email and password that I’d previously used to sign in to Heroku.
* Before I pushed the code from Gitpod to the Heroku server, I created two files – requirements.txt (which contained a list of the dependencies my site was using) and a Procfile.
* Once those were created, I was able to push the code to Heroku using the commands ‘git add,’ ‘git commit,’ and then ‘git push heroku master.’

### Deploying the website

### Code
* I used [W3C Markup Validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the HTML code.
* I used [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate the CSS code.
